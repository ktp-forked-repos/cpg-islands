Description
------------
A CpG island locator using the Python programming language. Some of the tools that we plan on using include Python's `PySide`_ Graphical Library, which serves as a wrapper to the `Qt Library`_.

This is graduate research project associated with CIS 661 with Professor Jonathan Leidig at `Grand Valley State University`_.
