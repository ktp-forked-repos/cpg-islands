Our final paper is written using LaTeX. Compilation of the PDF requires SCons_.

To install SCons into a virtual environment (created using virtualenv_), use::

    easy_install http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-2.2.0.tar.gz

Please note that I haven't been able to install SCons successfully using ``pip install``.
