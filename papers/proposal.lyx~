Topic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CpG islands are a cluster of nucleotides that are often observed in DNA.
 We will be researching the importance of CpG islands in a variety of different
 genomes.
 The goal of this project is writing a program in the Python programming
 language to analyze DNA for CpG islands using a Hidden Markov model-based
 approach.
 When provided with a DNA sequence, the program will provide a graphical
 visualization of possible CpG islands within sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Executive Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CpG islands are generally located directly upstream from genes in the genome.
 In order to aide the crucial process of mapping genes onto different genomes,
 we will be creating a tool that will scan a genome for possible CpG islands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We will first create a program that when given a DNA string, it will output
 likely locations for CpG islands in a graphical interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After a functional program has been created, a functional user interface
 in needed to load input files, display output, and other useful functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After finishing the design, we will code the graphical user interface and
 link it into the first program that we had created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We will then optimize the program and add new features to the user interface
 until the final deliverables are due.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Responsibilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will be developing using a versioning tool called git.
 New code will be added and distributed through an online repository.
 We plan to develop the project jointly, but each have specific elements
 that we will oversee.
 Sean plans on overseeing the user interface using PySide, and Gray will
 oversee the development of the DNA comparison program.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Our program will be written using a software engineering technique called
 Test-Driven development.
 In order to add new features to the program, a new test case needs to be
 created for the new feature.
 This test case is added to the any other test cases already written, and
 the entire suite of test cases is run against the program.
 This ensures that no older features break as new code is added, and that
 only code essential to the program is added.
